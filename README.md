# SampleSize4MCTP
R Code for the article "Sample size planning for multiple contrast tests" by Anna Pöhlmann and Frank Konietschke.

#### What the project does:
This is the R code used for the simulation and application sections in the paper "Sample size planning for multiple contrast tests". To facilitate the applicability, we provide a Shiny app. The code of the app can be found here. Soon also a live version will be available.

#### Why the project is useful:
Sample size calculations for two (independent) samples are well established and applied in (pre-)clinical research.
When planning several samples, sample size planning tools based on analysis of variance methods are available. Underlying effect sizes are hard to interpret and
we therefore employ multiple contrast tests instead. We propose methods to compute the sample size for heteroscedastic designs and purely nonparametric Steel-type tests in a flexible way. This includes any multiple comparisons, e.g., the many-to-one or all-pairs comparison, any variance pattern, and balanced or unbalanced designs.

#### Where users can get help:
Background knowledge on the implemented theory can be found in "Sample size planning for multiple contrast tests".

#### Who maintains and contributes to the project:
The code was written by Anna Pöhlmann and Frank Konietschke.
